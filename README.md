# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I present a collection of projects that highlight my skills as a Data Analyst. Using tools such as SQL, Power BI, and Python, these projects address complex data challenges and deliver actionable insights through data exploration, transformation, and visualization.

Each project demonstrates how I apply advanced analytical techniques to uncover patterns, generate meaningful insights, and support data-driven decision-making across diverse scenarios.

The projects include:

- SQL Projects: Database creation, querying datasets, and optimizing SQL queries for efficient data analysis.
  - [Game Store](https://github.com/andre-pedro/portfolio/blob/main/game-store.sql)
  - [Library](https://github.com/andre-pedro/portfolio/blob/main/library.sql)
  
- Power BI Dashboards: Development of interactive and dynamic dashboards to effectively communicate business metrics and trends.

- Python Analysis: Data exploration, predictive modeling, and automation using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
