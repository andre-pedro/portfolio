# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I showcase several real and simulated projects that demonstrate my skills as a Data Analyst. These projects utilize SQL, Power BI, and Python to solve complex data problems, providing actionable insights through data exploration, manipulation, and visualization.
Explore each project to see how I apply advanced data analysis techniques to extract value from data in different scenarios.

The projects include:

- SQL Projects: Database creation, querying large datasets, and optimizing SQL queries for efficient data analysis.
  - [Game Store](https://github.com/andre-pedro/portfolio/blob/main/game-store)

- Power BI Dashboards: Development of interactive and dynamic dashboards to effectively communicate business metrics and trends.

- Python Analysis: Data exploration, predictive modeling, and automation using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
