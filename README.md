# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I present a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills as a Data Analyst. Using tools such as SQL, Power BI, and Python, these projects address data challenges and generate meaningful insights through exploration, transformation, and visualization.

Each project shows how I apply data analysis concepts and techniques to identify patterns, extract valuable information, and support data-driven decision-making in different contexts. I created these projects to showcase my abilities as I seek my first professional opportunity in the field of data analytics.
The projects include:

- SQL Projects: Database creation, querying datasets, and optimizing SQL queries for efficient data analysis.
  - [Game Store](https://github.com/andre-pedro/portfolio/blob/main/game-store.sql)
  - [Library](https://github.com/andre-pedro/portfolio/blob/main/library.sql)
  
- Power BI Dashboards: Development of interactive and dynamic dashboards to effectively communicate business metrics and trends.

- Python Analysis: Data exploration, predictive modeling, and automation using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
